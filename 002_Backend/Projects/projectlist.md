# Getting Started

For each project:

- Set up your environment: Initialize a new Node.js project and install necessary dependencies.
- Plan your project: Define the features and functionality you need to implement.
- Start coding: Begin with the basic setup and incrementally add features.
- Test: Make sure to test your code to ensure it works as expected.
- Learn and iterate: Reflect on what you learned, and try to improve your code and add more features.

These projects will progressively teach you more about Node.js and its ecosystem, helping you build a solid foundation in back-end development. Happy coding!
